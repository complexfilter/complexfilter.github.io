* I am a computer scientist on computational photography and machine learning at Adobe Inc.. I earned my Ph.D. in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://eceweb.rice.edu/) at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/). During my Ph.D. studies, I have had the fortune to work with Prof. [Michael Orchard](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/michael-orchard).

* My research interests lie in the area of image processing and computational photography, particularly in image interpolation, aliasing mitigation for image display, fusion, and compression.
* I had a great summer as a research intern at Facebook in Menlo Park, CA. 
* I had a great summer as a research intern at MERL in Cambridge, MA. 
* I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in [Tianjin University](http://www.tju.edu.cn/english/index.htm).
